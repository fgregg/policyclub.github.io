*Unfortunately due to data constraints we only analyzed data at the half mile, however SB 827 will not affect the quarter mile level in Los Angeles. 

While the City of Los Angeles has a complex zoning code, the Policy Club developed a map which estimates the effects of SB 827 on Los Angeles. This is the first look at how SB 827 will affect individual communities from the San Fernando Valley to San Pedro. 

Koreatown, DTLA, San Pedro, North Valley suburban neighborhoods will stay suburban. Most single family neighborhoods will remain untouched, SB 827 will only affect areas near transit. 

**WHY THIS MATTERS**

**LOS ANGELES NEEDS MORE HOUSING**

Home prices have [reached historic highs](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-home-prices-20180124-story.html) with the median housing price hovering over $570,009, a 9.6% increase from the year before. Rents continue to rise and consume more of renter’s paychecks than ever before as [58% of renters](https://la.curbed.com/2015/12/10/9892338/los-angeles-rent-burden-most-unaffordable) spend upwards of 30% of their income on rent alone. 

**THE STATUS QUO IS EXPENSIVE **

Ask anyone looking for an apartment in Los Angeles how their search is coming along and the first thing they’ll probably say is how expensive and difficult it is to find somewhere to live.

The [average rent](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/los-angeles/) for a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles is $1,965, that means a renter will pay $23,580 for a one-bedroom over the course of a year. Los Angeles County’s [median household income is $57,952](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/losangelescountycalifornia/PST045216), if the median household paid the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment, more than 40% of their income would go towards rent alone -- this wouldn’t include groceries, utilities, or parking (if it’s not already included in your rent). 

Rents in Los Angeles will continue to rise, the annual [USC Lusk Center’s Casden Economics Forecast](https://lusk.usc.edu/casden) estimates average monthly rents in L.A. County will rise an additional $136 a month by 2019. [Increasing rents](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/rising-rents-are-pushing-more-tenants-past-the-breaking-point) have been found to push renters further out from job centers or worse, end up evicted and [possibly homeless](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-yir-lopez-year-housing-review-20171219-story.html).

**BUILD MORE TO LOWER PRICES**

*The answer to high housing costs is not difficult: building more housing will increase supply and lower prices. *

Los Angeles has many options to dramatically increase the number of new housing units in the City - and not all require zoning changes. One option is to build on existing underutilized multifamily parcels, according to a [report by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/closing-californias-housing-gap) this could add an additional 306,000 housing units—a 9 percent increase in the City’s current total housing stock of 3.4 million units. 

A [recent UCLA Anderson Report](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/Documents/areas/ctr/forecast/reports/uclaforecast_Sept2017_Nickelsburg.pdf)calculated that a 20% increase in the number of housing units would reduce prices by 10%, which means the City would need an additional 1.25 million housing units to bring prices down to 2014 levels. ([CurbedLA says $1700?](https://la.curbed.com/2014/10/7/10038342/los-angeles-median-rent-shoots-up-again-to-1716))

**WHAT SB 827 WILL AND WON’T DO**

SB 827 will exempt projects within one-half mile radius of a major transit stop or a one-quarter mile radius of a high-quality transit corridor from any:

(1) Maximum controls on residential density.

(2) Minimum automobile parking requirements.

(3) Any design standard that restricts the applicant’s ability to construct the maximum number of units consistent with any applicable building code.

This type of development is known as transit oriented development and has been shown to [improve public health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379710002977) and [improve the environment](http://www.vtpi.org/renne_tod.pdf).

SB 827 would also sets minimum heights with a ½ mile for buildings at 45, 55, or 85 feet  depending on proximity to transit and local road width—  which translates to a minimum height between 4 and 8 stories. However, local communities can allow for greater heights (ie, Downtown LA).

**Our map and data analysis found that no height limits will change within a half mile of transit for the City of Los Angeles. The areas affected are already zoned accordingly.**

**WHY IS IT SO HARD TO BUILD IN L.A.? IT’S COMPLICATED.**

The City of Los Angeles has more than 69 different zoning areas within the City’s 503 square miles. But, that’s just the number of zoning areas in one out of 88 cities that make up LA County’s more than 4,751 square miles. Building anything in the region is complicated, but multifamily housing in particular requires numerous [permits](https://www.ladbs.org/services/core-services/plan-check-permit/types-of-permit-processes), [inspections](http://www.ladbs.org/services/core-services/inspection) and approvals that typically take years from blueprint to ribbon-cutting. Not to mention the chance that everything can get delayed in courts because of the [California Environmental Quality Act](http://resources.ca.gov/ceqa/guidelines/), which requires local and state agencies to identify and mitigate any environmental impacts of their actions. For a primer on CEQA check out [CurbedLA’s field guide](https://la.curbed.com/2012/2/7/10398386/a-field-guide-to-ceqa-and-its-controversies).

In the City of Los Angeles alone there are:

14 different multiple residential zoning area types including "R4" zoning which lumps together churches, schools, child care, and homeless shelters.

12 different commercial and manufacturing zoning area types including "MR1" a strange combination that allows for light industrial use, mortuaries and animal keeping.

12 different residential estate and one-family residential zoning area types. 

**NOT IN MY BACKYARD (NIMBY)**

A small, vocal group of individuals, known as NIMBYs, can halt or radically change housing plans that do not conform with their personal standards. The [Casden West LA](https://la.curbed.com/2013/6/26/10226970/casdenwestla-chopping-off-7-stories-target-supermarket) is a recent example of NIMBYism that would have brought 638 residential units, a supermarket, and a Target within .2 miles or a 5 minute walk from the Pico-Sepulveda Expo line light rail station. After an outcry from a small contingent of neighborhood groups that reached the ears of several local politicians, the development was brought down to 595 units with no supermarket or Target. 

The opposition of new housing from small neighborhood groups has even [lead to a split in the Westwood Neighborhood Council](https://la.curbed.com/2017/11/9/16621190/westwood-neighborhood-council-westwood-students-housing), where UCLA students want to form their own Neighborhood Council to build more housing near their own campus. The area around UCLA has some of the [highest rents in Los Angeles](http://dailybruin.com/2016/04/08/westwood-rent-prices-highest-in-los-angeles/) where the median rent for a two bedroom apartment is about $4,200. 

**ADDRESSING THE REDLINE**

A depression-era Federal agency, the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), created a series of maps that graded neighborhoods by their credit riskiness. Wealthy, predominantly white communities such as Beverly Hills were outlined in green, reflecting low-risk. While, lower-income and ethnically diverse communities such as East and South Los Angeles were outlined in red, reflecting high-risk. Redlining infamously became known later as de facto segregation and has been linked to[ lower rates of home ownership, lower credit scores and lower home values](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12). 

For the first time in decades, large swaths of Los Angeles, including Beverly Hills, that were out of reach due to historical redlining, will be available to develop new housing. 

**OUR NEXT STEPS**

We're going to continue analyzing this data for more information about how SB 827 and this year's Housing Package will affect CA. Keep an eye out for an demographic analysis soon! 

Addition, we welcome contributions to our [zoning-metadata standard](http://github.com/policyclub/zoning-metadata) so that we can add more cities to the map.
